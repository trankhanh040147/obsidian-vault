#delay-gratification #habit 
- [ ] What is delay gratification ? 
	- [ ] The ability to have whatever we want in an instant weakens our self-regulation muscles
	- [ ] Most goals can be reached, but they don't happen by accident. They also don't get realized by an instant
## Delay Gratification Excercises
- One of the easiest ways to begin exercising your delay muscles is by practicing mindfulness to undo “autopilot” thinking.
- Another way to bolster a lower strength is by using it in a new way every day.
- This will likely feel inauthentic and difficult at first, but it can have long-term rewards. Here are some steps to build a lower strength, like self-regulation:

1. Choose the strength you’d like to build.
   -> Self-regulation
2. Create a visual cue.
   -> I hate being controlled by something. I will not let my impulses control me.
3. Make the strength’s use part of daily routine.
   -> When i feel like watching Youtube. I will repeat the cue
4. Give yourself a reward when you successfully use it.
   -> I can rest for 5 min if I can beat an impulse

- [x] APPLY: I want to watch Sleep Token reaction now
	- [x] todo: repeat cue (I hate being controlled by something. I will not let my impulses control me)
