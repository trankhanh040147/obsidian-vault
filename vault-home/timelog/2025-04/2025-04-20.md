- [x] difficulty: hardly understand nvim configs
- **Learn the basics of Lua**
    
    - **Why?** Neovim’s new config format is pure Lua, not Vimscript.
        
    - **How?**
        
        - Work through “Learn Lua in 15 Minutes” or the official Lua 5.x Reference Manual for syntax, tables, functions.
            
        - Solve tiny exercises: write a function that takes a table and returns its keys, play with loops, string ops, etc.
            
- **Familiarize yourself with Neovim’s Lua API**
    
- **Why?** You’ll be calling `vim.opt`, `vim.api.nvim_*`, `vim.keymap.set`, etc.
        
    - **How?**
        
        - Inside Neovim run `:help lua-guide` and `:help vim.api`.
            
        - Experiment in `:lua` command—e.g. `:lua vim.opt.number = true` to turn on line numbers.
            
- **Understand plugin management with Lazy.nvim**
    
    - **Why?** It’s what loads and configures every plugin you’ll use.
        
    - **How?**
        
        - Read the Lazy.nvim README on GitHub: it walks through basic setup, the structure of a plugin spec, lazy‑loading, and the `config` hook.
            
        - Start by installing just one plugin (say “nvim‑tree”), configure it inline in your `init.lua`, then move that config into a separate Lua file.
            
- **Explore an example distro (NVChad or LazyVim)**
    
    - **Why?** They’re real‑world modular configs that use all these ideas.
        
    - **How?**
        
        - Clone NVChad or LazyVim into a disposable folder and read through how they split files into `core/`, `lua/plugins/`, `lua/configs/`.
            
        - Try disabling parts of it to see what each module does.
            
- **Build your own minimal config**
    
    - **Start** with only:
        
        lua
        
        Copy
        
        `vim.g.mapleader = " " require("lazy").setup({   { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter", run = ":TSUpdate" }, }) vim.opt.number = true`
        
    - **Then** add one new thing at a time: keymaps, an autocommand, then another plugin.
        
    - **Move** each block into `lua/` sub‑files as it grows.
        
- **Practice reading and refactoring**
    
    - **Why?** The more you break big configs into small modules, the clearer each piece becomes.
        
    - **How?** Take someone else’s working `init.lua`, identify one plugin’s setup, extract it into `lua/plugins/foo.lua`, and wire it via Lazy’s `config` hook.
        
- **Use interactive help & debugging**
    
    - In Neovim run `:checkhealth lazy` or `:checkhealth mason` to catch load‑order errors.
        
    - Set `vim.notify = print` in your `init.lua` to see startup messages.
        
    - Sprinkle `print(">> loaded module X")` in your Lua files to confirm they’re running.
        
- **Leverage community resources**
    
    - YouTube channels like “ThePrimeagen” or “TJ DeVries” have great Neovim‑Lua deep dives.
        
    - Join the Neovim Discord or Reddit r/neovim to ask questions and see how others structure configs.
- [ ] learn Lua 5.0 Reference Manual
- [ ] solve Lua exercises
	- [ ] write a function that takes a table and returns its keys, play with loops, string ops, etc.
- [ ] refactor init.lua
	- [ ] 1. Move Mason & LSP setup to lua/configs/lspconfig.lua  
	- [ ] 2. Move Go autocmd (gofmt) into lua/plugins/go.lua or configs  
	- [ ] 3. Use lua/plugins/init.lua to list plugin specs, importing submodules  
	- [ ] 4. Keep init.lua minimal: only bootstrap and require core modules.
- [ ] add stylua

#nvim #lua 
- [x] LUA #2.1 – Lexical Conventions
- [x] LUA #2.2 – Values and Types
    - LUA is a dynamically typed language
    - There are eight basic types in Lua: nil, boolean, number, string, function, userdata, thread, and table
    - Lua is 8-bit clean: Strings may contain any 8-bit character, including embedded zeros ('\0') (see 2.1).
    - Functions are first-class values in Lua.
