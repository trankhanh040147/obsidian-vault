	#jwt
	- [x] learn about JWT
		- [x] ParseUnverified
			- [ ] what does it do?
				- [ ] parse the token without validate the signature
					- [ ] what is the signature ? 
						- [ ] the last part of the token segments
						- [ ] contains: ___
					- [ ] step 1: split the tokens into 3 parts: header, claims, signature
						- [ ] delimiter is ,
						- [ ] the token must be exactly 3 parts with 2 delimiter, otherwise it fails the splitTokens process
					- [ ] step 2: DecodeSegment the header
						- [ ] the header is encoded in base64 format, so the decode segment process will base64 decode it
						- [ ] base64 decode technique have 2 options: 
							- [ ] PaddingAllowed
								- [ ] if there is redundant characters of =, the segment will be appened 4-(len%4) characters of = AND encoding will be Base64UrlEncoding
							- [ ] Strict
			- [ ] why unverified ? how about verified
