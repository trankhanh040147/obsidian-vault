# Room
- size: 12x12
`I like to start with a 12*12 room, which means setting the walls at 14*14. You can go smaller, but I don't like rebuilding so I go big from the start. 12 is the widest you can make any roof before you need to put in supports (All walls and columns support roof in a 6-tile radius). Inside, you put 3 beds for your colonists to sleep in. Add a door faced towards your crops.`

# Stockpile
This room is going to be your living space for a bit. Put a stockpile along the length of one of the walls 3 squares wide. The reason we put a stockpile inside is because most materials and objects deteriorate if left outside. They slowly lose hp and value. Once they reach 0%, they're destroyed. Most items remain fully functional up until the moment of destruction. Once inside a roofed room, this deterioration stops. You'll want to set the Priority of this stockpile to low. Do so by clicking Storage, then click Priority:Normal and change it. We do this so everything will only go here if a better place isn't available.

# Growing 
- Up next, Growing Zones. As mentioned, Rich Soil is ideal but regular soil will do.
