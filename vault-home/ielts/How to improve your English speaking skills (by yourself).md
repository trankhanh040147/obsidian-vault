#speaking #technique
- Technique: Learning to speak English through imitation
- This technique can help: Improve grammar, vocabulary, **improve ability to express your thoughts and ideas effectively**
- This technique is not speak along after native speakers using the exact same words to improve pronunciation (which how I practice lately)
- Here's how it works: Try to listen to a speech, a story, a conversation, then try to repeat that story by your own words/thoughts
- Example of this technique in action: 
  "when i was a child" --> when he was a child
  "my parent like to pretend, like many other parents" --> he parents like to pretend, like many other parents
