Nowadays, many young people experience significant pressure to excel academically in preparation for their future careers. They often spend most of their time studying, leaving little to no time for leisure activities. There are several reasons for this issue, and naturally, there are solutions available to alleviate this situation. This essay will examine these causes and suggest potential solutions.

Firstly, regarding the causes, the primary cause is undoubtedly the demanding nature of modern academic curricula. Universities and colleges frequently impose intensive schedules that require compulsory attendance and significant commitment. Moreover, after attending classes, students often receive numerous assignments that consume a large portion of their freetime at home. However, these reasons alone do not entirely account for their lack of leisure time. In fact, other contributing factors exist as well. Students frequently are required to undertake additional school-related tasks to fulfill graduation criteria. For examples, many educational institutions require students to complete voluntary activities, participate in seminars, contribute to community service projects.
