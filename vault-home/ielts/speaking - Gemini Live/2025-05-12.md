I am taking an emulator speaking test and here is the transcript: 

**Me:** Okay, can you repeat the topic for me? Sure thing The topic is your favorite book Oh, okay, what should I talk about the topic?

**Examiner:** You can start by telling me the title and author of the book Then you can talk about what the book is about The plot, the characters, and the setting Don't forget to mention why you like it so much and how it has impacted you

**Me:** Okay, I see So, first, the title of the book Okay, let's see It's Norwegian Wood by Murasaki It's about a love story and... Okay, first there are some characters which begin with the main character Watanabe. He is in the context.

**Examiner:** Okay, I'm ready to hear about the characters in Norwegian Wood. Who is Watanabe and what is he like?

**Me:** Yeah, Watanabe, you know, he is a student and he is studying in university and he is living in a dorm He lives with a friend. His roommate is called Storm Trooper. We don't know his actual name. And they live both together in the Dorm and you know the context, the time of the story is around 1960s I think and first this is like I said, this is a love story, right? So Watanabe must be in love with someone, you know, and is that girl is introduced in the beginning the first part of the beginning scene of the book and They and the scene that scene is very strange they The girl called Naoko is a friend of Watanabe. In the first scene, Watanabe is in a commute train and he arrives at somewhere to meet... That's an interesting start.

**Examiner:** It sounds like the beginning of the book sets a mysterious tone. What happens between Watanabe and Naoko on the train?

**Me:** Oh yeah, it's very interesting. They both meet and at first we don't know the relationship about them And when I was reading the book at that scene, I think they are both lovers but no, they kinda like lovers but after a short power up we know they have a deep relationship and so I can tell you shortly That's a great observation Okay, I'm ready to hear what happens next Yeah, so they are friends for a long time and Naoko has a boyfriend that his name... I can't remember his name Let's call him Ray, okay? I remember his name kinda sound like that Okay, Ray So Naoko is a girlfriend is Ray's girlfriend and... but Ray was dead a year ago at 17 and he's dead because he suicided and the real reason we don't know about that but Watanabe is the closest friend of Ray and He knows Naoko and they kinda like... Every time they go out, Rei, Naoko and Watanabe always go together But Naoko and Rei are couples, you know? And that relationship kinda strange in every perspective, right? In any perspective So yeah, and then when Rei is dead Naoko feel... Naoko change and Also, Watanabe... No, Watanabe... After Rei's death, Watanabe feel a loneliness, a kind of loneliness in him and he don't know what to do Also, he don't really determined about his future and he... We can say he's a little depressed About Naoko, she's changed but we don't know how much We don't know what kind of change she had but She's kinda like a little better, she loses her weight, she becomes more beautiful at least in Watanabe's eyes and then Naoko and Watanabe have... no, by chance, they met by chance after Redead because after Redead, they are not They did not meet each other after his death. And then 2 years or 3 years later, they met in a commute train. And then they began to contact and meet each other often. more often than before because before that they never met, they have never met yeah and then Watanabe and Naoko each time they meet they just walking together because the relationship between Naoko and Watanabe is very strange in a way that they rarely talk with each other when they go out with Rei and when every time when Naoko and Watanabe in in in

**Examiner:** That's an interesting dynamic. It sounds like their relationship is built on shared experiences and unspoken understanding. The fact that they rarely talked when Ray was alive adds another layer of complexity to their connection.

**Me:** Oh, yeah. And then they met again. And now they've been together, but they're not a couple. You know, they often walk along and They rarely speak with each other, but they more like expose to each other to confess their feelings more and whatever Watanabe failed for her, we can say that And Naoko also failed for him But they are not so open about it And then, he... and then at Naoko's 20th birthday, Naoko's birthday They have sex with each other, they have sex and then Watanabe asks Naoko why they, I mean Rei and Naoko have never had sex before. And then Naoko kinda feel like she's a little bit emotional. You know, at the night, at her 20th birthday, they are together. And she's kinda like... she's strange, you know? She talks more and she feels a little bit emotional than everyday And then she cried in an aggressive way. And then they have sex. And then Watanabe after that, Watanabe asked her why, why Rei and- That's a powerful moment.

**Examiner:** It's a- Okay, I'm ready to hear what Naoko said about Rei.

**Me:** What I never ask Naoko and why Naoko and Rei have never have sex before and then Naoko feels like She didn't want to talk with Watanabe anymore. After that day, she left Tokyo and went to Shintori. Yeah, and then Watanabe wants to meet her so desperately. Yeah, and that is about 20% of the story. Yeah, that's it.

**Examiner:** That's a significant development in the story. It sounds like Watanabe is determined to find Naoko. I wonder what will happen when they reunite.

**Me:** Okay, that's it. We should not dive deeper in the story because it's already long. And now, can you give me some reviews? Okay, let's go.

**Examiner:** Okay, I'm ready to give you some feedback. What would you like me to focus on?

**Me:** About everything. Just give me some reviews.

**Examiner:** Okay, here's some general feedback. Your pronunciation is clear and you speak at a good pace. You have a good grasp of vocabulary and grammar and your descriptions are quite vivid. In terms of content, you've captured the essence of Norwegian wood and its complex relationships. You effectively conveyed the emotional depth of the characters and their struggles. To make it even better, you could try to incorporate more descriptive language and vary your sentence structure. Also, remember to maintain consistent verb tenses throughout your storytelling. Overall, you did a great job. Keep practicing, and you'll do fantastic in your IELTS test.

**Me:** But what can I improve? Like, what can I upset instead? And what should I focus more? And what are my mistakes?

**Examiner:** Okay, let's talk about areas for improvement. You sometimes use filler words like um and uh, which can slightly disrupt the flow of your speech. Try to pause instead of using those fillers. Also, be mindful of your verb tenses, as there were a few instances where they shifted unexpectedly. Finally, while your vocabulary is good, incorporating more idiomatic expressions could elevate your language and make it sound more natural.

**Me:** Okay, thank you.

**Examiner:** You're welcome. Do you want to delve deeper into any specific aspect of your speaking performance or perhaps explore a new topic?

**Me:** That's enough for today.

**Examiner:** Alright, it was great working with you today. Feel free to reach out if you want to practice again.
