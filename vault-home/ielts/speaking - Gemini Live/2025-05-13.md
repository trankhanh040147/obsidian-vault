**Me:** Hello?

**Examiner:** Hi there. What can I help you with?

**Me:** Ok, John is a guy from France and have been stay in Vietnam for 4 months We are introduced by a friend and today we first meet each other Let's act like John and have a conversation with me Please give me some suggestions to ask you when seeing I'm stuck, ok?

**Examiner:** Ah, enchanté. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. I've heard so much about you from our mutual friend. So what brings you here? Are you on holiday? Or do you live in Vietnam?

**Me:** Oh yeah, bonjour, l'm a bear, Khanh. You can call me Kenny or simply Ken. And I'm from Vietnam. I have been living in Vietnam my whole life. And you know, I'm a graduated student and currently working in a company. And how about you? I think I have know that you are also a student, right?

**Examiner:** Well, I was a student, but now I'm a teacher. I teach French here in Ho Chi Minh City. What about you? What do you do for work?

**Me:** Yeah, you know, I'm a software developer and I'm currently working in Tân Bình at a technology company and I have... What should I ask you?

**Examiner:** Ah, a software developer, that's a... I'm working on a mobile app for a local startup. It's been pretty challenging, but also really rewarding.

**Me:** What about you? Yeah, you know, I'm working on a multi-platform chat app and it's quite, yeah, it's quite a large app and we have been developing this app for this project, this product for 8 years and now we have 100k users active users, you know and We have a lot to do Wow 100,000 active users.

**Examiner:** That's impressive. What kind of chat app is it? Is it for a specific community or more general use?

**Me:** It's not for channel reviews because it's limited for a group of people not a repeater but you have to have you have to got a invitation code in order to have access to register an account so yeah not everyone can use that can use our product and we kinda very very we are our product is this size to have a high security yeah

**Examiner:** That sounds intense. Working on a project with such a large user base and high security requirements must be quite a challenge. What's the most interesting thing you've learned while working on it?

**Me:** The most interesting thing? Yeah, maybe about the WebSocket server, you know when working with a chat app the WebSocket server is the most important thing because it is the main backbone of the chat app because if we can chat We can't message each other Also, we can't receive messages from others It's useless, right? And I personally have never had a experience working with a websocket I have no experience developing a websocket so now I know how to develop a websocket and able to know the challenges also what I should do when I develop WebSockets for best practice so yeah, it's quite interesting That's for sure It's great that you're learning so much about WebSockets Have you encountered any unexpected challenges while working on this project? You know, yeah, I have a lot of challenges working in this company You know when before I have one job before and I I am not specifically actually a backend developer so I like a lot of I have never been into a large, you can say a general, a good, I don't know, a technology stack like this in this company. we use Portainer, Kibana Portainer for managing docker services Kibana for logging and a lot of different things that I have never have experienced before so it's quite challenging to learn all of that and be experienced at it and after a long time Yeah, can we continue?

**Examiner:** Absolutely. I'm really enjoying our conversation. So you were telling me about the tech stack you're working with. It sounds like you're learning a lot.

**Me:** Yeah, I have learned a lot about tech stack, portendor, kibana, and... Yeah, that's it. And we use Kafka for... Messaging... Message... Broker... Messaging... Yeah? Messaging... Media for... Storing... For... Storing resources... And other things... That's a solid setup.

**Examiner:** Kafka is... Ah, I see. It sounds like you're working with a lot of different technologies. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss further?

**Me:** No, how about you?

**Examiner:** Well, I'm always happy to talk about technology, but I'm also interested in hearing more about your experiences in Vietnam. What do you enjoy most about living here?

**Me:** Ah, I see. Yeah. In Vietnam, it's... The life expense is quite cheap, you know. And the food is... The food here is very good. And the weather is not so cold as some other countries and in Vietnam we don't have any kind of earthquake or volcano.

**Examiner:** That's wonderful. I haven't had a chance to travel much yet but I'm hoping to see more of the country soon. Do you have any recommendations?

**Me:** Yeah, you can travel to Huế, Đà Nẵng, Phú Quốc. These places are often, there are a lot, very attractive to... You know, these are the most attractive places I can imagine. And... I think it's very worth to visit.

**Examiner:** I'll definitely add them to my list. Thanks for the recommendations.
