Q: [Method] Adults that have ACTUALLY developed a growth mindset, how?

- There are some dynamics u have to work to get over.  So you can do some excercises to *deliberately* fail, or simply do things without caring. It's a hangup, so work towards getting over the "fail" phobia and you'll be on your way towards a growth mindset. 

>  I bike up a pretty steep hill; I get passed by other bikers like I'm standing still; hell, I get passed by joggers. But why would I care about them, it's a success for me. The average person wouldn't be able to bike up the hill at all, and when I started I couldn't either.

- I'm an engineer, so for me literally everything is interesting because it's measurable, models can be created, opportunities for automation, there's a basis in science, materials, biology, etc. 

>  **Not everyone thinks like me and I don't expect people to;** my wife is more of an artist, so she sees colors, patterns, creativity, emotion, beauty in ways that aren't obvious to me, but I can still see it and appreciate it when she points things out. Others are more pro-social, they see power in social networks; in my mind there's a socio-economic aspect that can be understood. Others are spiritual and see meaning and beauty in spirituality.

> **Children suck at everything and fail at everything, but they try, they fail, they get back up & try again, and they learn some incredibly difficult things, like languages, without really thinking of it as growth or learning. To them it's all "play."** At some point as adults "failure" becomes stigmatized, "play" becomes competitive, and we're suddenly afraid to fail, afraid to "lose," we imagine others are watching and laughing at our failures. 

- That's mostly in our heads; if there's people in your social circle like this, they're toxic and should be ignored. Failure is our greatest teacher, willingness to take risks and fail can be a superpower, so at a LATER adult point we (hopefully) learn to no longer be self-conscious about failure; 99.9% of the time no one sees or cares about failure. 

> The main point about failure is you can fail 1,000 times, 10,000 times, but the ONE success you have is the thing you talk about. There's the Thomas Edison & Michael Jordan quotes about how many failures they had that people mostly ignore, and how all the failed attempts led up to a far smaller number of key successes that we associate with them and remember them for.
