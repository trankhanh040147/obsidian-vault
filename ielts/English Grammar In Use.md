PRESENT SIMPLE
A
B
- We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general:
- examples:
	- I usually play football at Wednesday and play badminton at Tuesday once a week
	- My office opens at 7 in the morning
	- My father is a doctor
	- Developers work on computer

Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)

*Tom is looking for his key. He can’t find it.*

Ten minutes later:
*Now Tom has found his key. He has it now.*
*Has he lost his key? No, he has found it.*
*Did he lose his key? Yes, he did.*
*He lost his key (past simple)*
*but now he has found it. (present perfect)*
