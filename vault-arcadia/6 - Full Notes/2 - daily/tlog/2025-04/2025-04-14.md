* **Việc đã thực hiện**:    	
	- Hoàn thành update modify time drive api (100%)
	- Viết middleware drive-federated-api (2/4)
	- Present signet task 
* **Việc hôm nay**:
    - Hoàn thành middleware drive-federated
    - Update API Invite code (100%)
    - API complete upload v2
- **Khó khăn**: gặp lỗi tạo key khi dùng cặp key khác nhau

#work
- [x] middileware: EncryptResponse
- [x] add minio 
- [x] check model signet task
- [x] middleware: DecryptRequest
	- [x] generate a PEM encoded ed25519 key
        using: GPT's code --> wrong
        using: rorycl/ed25519genandsave.go
    - [x] generate public key use for curve25519 public key
        - [x] what format the public need to be in ?
            + 32bytes in length
            + not in pem format 
        - [x] now we need the private key in PEM format, but the public key is not in PEM, is it possible ?
            --> it is not possible, cuz the private_key and public need to be in [32] byte length
        - [x] generate new key pairs for curve25519
- [x] middleware: EncryptResponse
- [x] error: unpadding when use different key pairs for both
	- [x] reason: the share key created is different
		- [x] so, the share key must be the same in order to encrypt and decrypt successfully ?
    - [x] sol: use aes (aes128) instead of aes_qcm (aes256)

#dr
- [ ] fix ...
---
- [ ] research **curve25519**
	- [ ] **ParseECPrivateKeyFromPEM** vs **ParseEdPrivateKeyFromPEM**?
	- [ ] playground/curve25519 - write some codes to understand it process
	- [ ] HKDF ?
	- [ ] how **sdrive-federated** encryption & decryption works
	- [ ] how the shared key generated ?

#linux-dotfiles
   - [ ] ~/.dotfiles 101: **A Zero to Configuration Hero Blueprint**
      - [ ] remove unused 
      - [ ] fork nvchad repo and push it on github
      - [ ] replace by my onw
      - [ ] push nvim config
#vim 
- [ ] create short cut to check/uncheck checkbox 
#vim-auto-surround 
- [ ] using **surround.vim** to wrap tect in *
    - [ ] in **neovim** (use **kylechui/vim-surround** instead)
        - [ ] how to install a neovim config in **NVChad** style ?
    - [ ] install **vimplug** in **vim** and **neovim**
    - [ ] in **GoLand** ??

#hashing
- [ ] **sdrive-file-federated**: review check hash
    - [ ] how hash and check hash work ?
        + hash is a one-way mathemical function that turns data into a string of *nondescript* text that cannot be *reversed* or *decoded*. 
    - why we need hashing ?
        + to keep information we want to send to client can't be read by human    
        + ___
     - [ ] why we need check hash 
        +
    - [ ] how can hacker bypass the check hash process
    - [ ] what are best ways to check hash ?
	- [ ] add to [garden]: cryptography
