- [x] Why need Message Part ? Why not just a string only ? 
	- [x] MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
	That's an excellent question. An email isn't just a single block of text, which is why the `Message` struct uses the complex `MessagePart` structure instead of a simple string.
	
	The `MessagePart` model is necessary because modern emails are built using a standard called **MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)**. This standard allows an email to be a collection of different pieces, much like a folder containing various files. A simple string just can't represent this complexity.
	
	---
	
	### Key Reasons for the MessagePart Structure
	
	#### 1. Multiple Content Formats 💌
	
	Most modern emails are sent in two formats at once: **plain text** (`text/plain`) and **HTML** (`text/html`).
	
	- The **HTML** version allows for formatting like bold text, colors, links, and images.
	    
	- The **plain text** version is a fallback for email clients that can't or won't render HTML.
	    
	
	The `MessagePart` structure handles this by having a top-level part with a `mimeType` of `multipart/alternative`, which then contains two child `parts`: one for the plain text and one for the HTML.
	
	#### 2. Attachments 📎
	
	Attachments like PDFs, images, or Word documents are entirely separate parts of the email. A simple string for the body cannot contain a file. Each attachment is its own `MessagePart` with a specific `mimeType` (e.g., `application/pdf` or `image/jpeg`) and a `filename`.
	
	#### 3. Embedded Images and Content 🖼️
	
	Sometimes, images are displayed directly within the email body (inline images) rather than as separate attachments. These are also handled as distinct `MessagePart`s. The HTML part of the email will reference these image parts using a special content ID. This allows the email to be self-contained.
	
	---
	
	### How it Works: A Tree Structure
	
	You can think of an email's structure as a **tree**. The main `message.payload` is the root of the tree.
	
	- If the `mimeType` is `multipart/*` (like `multipart/mixed` or `multipart/alternative`), it means this part is a container. Its `parts` array will hold its children (the branches).
	    
	- If the `mimeType` is a simple type (like `text/plain` or `image/png`), it's a leaf node. Its `body` field contains the actual content, and its `parts` array will be empty.
	    
	
	**Example:** An email with an HTML body and a PDF attachment.
	
	- `message.payload` (Root `MessagePart`)
	    
	    - `mimeType`: `multipart/mixed`
	        
	    - `parts`: [
	        
	        1. `MessagePart` (for the body)
	            
	            - `mimeType`: `text/html`
	                
	            - `body`: { `data`: "PGgxPkhlbGxvPC9oMT4=" ... }
	                
	        2. `MessagePart` (for the attachment)
	            
	            - `mimeType`: `application/pdf`
	                
	            - `filename`: "report.pdf"
	                
	            - body: { attachmentId: "..." }
	                
	                ]
	                
	
	In short, using `MessagePart` gives you a complete and accurate representation of the email, allowing you to reliably parse the correct body format, find all attachments, and handle any other content it might contain. 👍
