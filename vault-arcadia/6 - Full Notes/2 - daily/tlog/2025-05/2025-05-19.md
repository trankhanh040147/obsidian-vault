- [ ] webhook usage
	- [ ] how do webhook works ?
	-   Webhooks are data and executable commands **sent from one app to another over HTTP** instead of through the command line in your computer, formatted in XML, JSON, or form-encoded serialization. They're called webhooks since they're **software hooks**—or functions that run when something happens—that work over the web. And they're typically secured through **obscurity**—each user of an application gets a unique, random URL to send webhook data to—though they can optionally be secured with a key or signature.

	-  Webhooks typically are used to connect two different applications. When an event happens on the trigger application, it serializes data about that event and sends it to a webhook URL from the action application—the one you want to do something based on the data from the first application.
- [ ] example
	- [ ] after customer ordered, the store have to create an invoice, in this case -- the webhook URL of the receiving app is the organization create the invoice
