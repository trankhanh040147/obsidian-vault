* **Việc đã thực hiện**:    	
	- Hoàn thành init project TLA bridge (100%)
	- Fix bug Survey (19084, 19092, 19083, 19057, 19093, 19094, 19095)
* **Việc hôm nay**:
	- Xử lý event nhận được từ Bridge - Message Forward Tla

#sigpro-msgws-forward-ai
- [x] test
	- [x] init a gossip gateway 
	- [ ] test send gossip from fw to worker
		- [ ] init gossip-playground && create a gossip message
- [x] why need to send to Bridge through Kafka but not Gossip ?
	- [x] cuz Bridge need access to database, it must be deployed in Docker Swarm. Meanwhile Gossip services (forward, worker) can only be in Bare Metal.
- [ ] why need consisten hashing ?

#gossip 
- [ ] what for ?
	Gossip is a communication protocol or mechanism primarily used for **scalable, decentralized, and reliable information dissemination** in distributed systems.
	
	### What is Gossip for?
	
	- **Data Propagation:** It helps spread updates, state information, or messages efficiently across many nodes without a central coordinator.
	    
	- **Fault Tolerance:** Because gossip protocols are decentralized and probabilistic, they handle node failures and network partitions gracefully.
	    
	- **Scalability:** Gossip scales well with the number of nodes, making it suitable for large distributed systems like peer-to-peer networks, distributed databases, and cluster management.
	    
	- **Consistency:** It helps nodes eventually reach a consistent state by continuously exchanging information in small chunks with random peers.
	    
	- **Load Balancing:** Distributes the communication load evenly since each node only talks to a few random others at a time.
	    
	
	### Common uses include:
	
	- **Distributed databases:** For membership and failure detection (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB).
	    
	- **Blockchain networks:** To spread new blocks and transactions.
	    
	- **Monitoring systems:** To propagate health and status information.
	    
	- **Cluster management:** For node discovery and state sharing.

**In short:** Gossip protocols let nodes "rumor" their knowledge randomly and repeatedly, ensuring that information eventually reaches everyone reliably and efficiently without bottlenecks or single points of failure.

If you want, I can give you a quick example or how gossip compares with other methods like broadcast or multicast!
