Act as a Calisthenic personal trainer. I'm a beginner and want a excercise schedule.
Current ability:

- Max pull up: 8
- Plank hold: 1min 
- Run: 4km/d
- Jumping Rob: N/A

Recommend excercises for me

Great goal. Based on your current abilities (18 push-ups, 8 pull-ups, 1-minute plank, 4 km daily run) and your beginner level in calisthenics, here is a structured 8-week progressive plan that builds size, strength, and intra-workout skill with gradually increasing difficulty and adequate recovery.

Assumptions and approach
- You train 4 days per week with 1–2 rest days.
- Each session includes a warm-up, main strength work, a skill or mobility drill, and a cool-down.
- You’ll use progressive overload: increase reps, add sets, reduce rest, or advance to a tougher variation when the current level becomes too easy.
- If you feel sharp pain (not just muscle fatigue), back off and consult a professional.

Weekly structure (repeat for Weeks 1–4, then adjust for Weeks 5–8)
- Day A: Push emphasis
- Day B: Pull emphasis
- Day C: Push/Pull and legs, plus core
- Day D: Mobility/skills, light cardio, core

Warm-up (all days)
- 3–5 minutes light cardio (jog in place, jump rope if available)
- Dynamic mobility: arm circles, shoulder dislocations with a hold, hip circles, ankle circles
- 6–8 warm-up reps of each movement pattern (e.g., incline push-ups, assisted pull-ups)

Core and mobility (all days)
- Plank variations: front plank, side planks; accumulate for 3 minutes total per session
- Hollow body progressions: tuck holds, hollow holds, progress to hollow body with extended legs as able

Progression strategy
- If you can perform the target rep range with good form for all sets, move to the next progression or add a set.
- If form degrades, stay at the current level an extra week or add repetitions with longer rest before progressing.

Detailed weekly plan (per session templates)
