A **network socket** is a software structure within a [network node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_node "Network node") of a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") (API) for the networking architecture. Sockets are created only during the lifetime of a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_\(computing\) "Process (computing)") of an application running in the node.

Because of the [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization "Standardization") of the [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP") protocols in the development of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), the term _network socket_ is most commonly used in the context of the Internet protocol suite, and is therefore often also referred to as **Internet socket**. In this context, a socket is externally identified to other hosts by its **socket address**, which is the triad of [transport protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_protocol "Transport protocol"), [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address"), and [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_number "Port number").

The term _socket_ is also used for the software endpoint of node-internal [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication "Inter-process communication") (IPC), which often uses the same API as a network socket.
