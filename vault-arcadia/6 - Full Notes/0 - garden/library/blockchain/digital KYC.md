- Digital KYC is a general term that covers various formats of online and remote identity verification using optical character recognition (OCR), which reads, analyses, and verifies data using biometric information. Digital KYC can be done in different ways, such as video-based eKYC, OCR-based eKYC, or face biometrics-based eKYC. Video-based eKYC involves a representative checking the customer remotely via video call and asking them to show their identity and address proof documents, such as national identity card, passport, driver’s license, etc. OCR-based eKYC involves scanning the customer’s documents using a mobile app or a web browser and extracting the relevant information automatically. Face biometrics-based eKYC involves capturing the customer’s face image using a camera and matching it with the photo on their identity document or national identity card.
