A CPU instruction is ==a command that a central processing unit (CPU) can understand and execute==. It's a binary number that directs the CPU to perform a specific operation on data. Instructions, along with data, are fetched from memory, decoded by the control unit, and then executed by the [[arithmetic logic unit (ALU)]]. 

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- **Basic Unit of Work:**
    
    Instructions are the fundamental units of computation within a CPU. 
    
- **Operation and Data:**
    
    Each instruction specifies both the operation to be performed (e.g., add, subtract, load, store) and the data the operation will act upon. 
    
- **Instruction Set:**
    
    The complete set of instructions a CPU can execute is called its [[instruction set architecture (ISA)]]. 
    
- **Components:**
    
    Instructions are typically composed of an operation code ([[opcode]]) specifying the operation and [[operands]] (e.g., registers, memory addresses) indicating where to find the data. 
    
- **Execution Cycle:**
    
    The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and then executes them in a continuous cycle. 
    
- **Examples:**
    
    Common instruction types include arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), data movement (load, store), and logical operations. 
    
- **Performance:**
    
    The speed at which a CPU can execute instructions (often measured in MIPS or GFLOPS) is a key factor in overall system performance.
