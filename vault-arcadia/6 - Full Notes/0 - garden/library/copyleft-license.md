**Definition**: A **copyleft** license is a type of open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software, but it requires that any modified versions of the software also be released under the same license. The goal of copyleft is to ensure that the freedoms to use, modify, and distribute the software remain intact, even when the software is modified or redistributed.

**How it Works**:
 - If you modify or distribute software under a copyleft license (like **GPL**), you must also release the source code of your modified version under the same copyleft license.
  - This ensures that **derivative works** (modified versions) remain open-source and accessible to the community. For example, if you create a new version of a GPL-licensed project, your new version must also be licensed under GPL.
