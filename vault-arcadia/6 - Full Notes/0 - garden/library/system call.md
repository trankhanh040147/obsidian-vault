In computing, a **system call** (**syscall**) is the programmatic way in which a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") requests a service from the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system")[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call#cite_note-1) on which it is executed. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive "Hard disk drive") or accessing the device's camera), creation and execution of new [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_\(computing\) "Process (computing)"), and communication with integral [kernel services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_service "Kernel service") such as [process scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_scheduling "Process scheduling"). System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.

In most systems, system calls can only be made from [userspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userspace "Userspace") processes, while in some systems, [OS/360 and successors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors "OS/360 and successors") for example, privileged system code also issues system calls.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call#cite_note-2)

For [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system"), system calls typically do not change the [privilege mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_modes "CPU modes") of the CPU.

# Examples and tools
On Unix, Unix-like and other POSIX-compliant operating systems, popular system calls are ==open, read, write, close, wait, exec, fork, exit, and kill==. Many modern operating systems have hundreds of system calls. For example, Linux and OpenBSD each have over 300 different calls,[2][3] NetBSD has close to 500,[4] FreeBSD has over 500,[5] Windows has close to 2000, divided between win32k (graphical) and ntdll (core) system calls[6] while Plan 9 has 54.[7]Tools such as strace, ftrace and truss allow a process to execute from start and report all system calls the process invokes, or can attach to an already running process and intercept any system call made by the said process if the operation does not violate the permissions of the user. This special ability of the program is usually also implemented with system calls such as ptrace or system calls on files in procfs.
