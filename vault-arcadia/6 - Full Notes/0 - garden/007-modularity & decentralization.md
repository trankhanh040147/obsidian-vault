## Modularity vs Modularization
- Modularity, on the one hand, refers to the _degree_ to which a system can be built from distinct subsystems that are smaller and more or less self-contained—the modules. **Modularity is a system property.** 
- Modularization, on the other hand, is the _process_ of decomposing a system into modules. You increase the number of subsystems and sharpen their boundaries by modularization. **Modularization is a methodology.**

## Benefits of Modularity
- **Simplicity**: each module is desgined to perform a set of closely related functions, making the overall system easier to understand and manage
- **Maintainability:** When a system is modularized, maintenance becomes easier as each module can be tested and debugged independently. If a problem arises in a particular module, it can often be fixed without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Reusability:** Modules can be reused in different systems if they are designed well. This reusability significantly saves time and resources in development.
- **Parallel Development:** Different teams can work on different modules concurrently, which significantly speeds up the development process.
