#reflection
- What is happening to me ? 
	- I feel like I have no leisure time, why ? --> Stop practicing badminton is the right idea
	- Until I **get a better job** and **maintain good learning habits**, I will continue practice badminton 
- How about at home ? 
	- The frustration: I feel the frustation and start **scrolling**, mainly because I hate the fuzzy of messages.
- How about now ?
	- What should I do ? --> Reset bad sums up. Start good actions
	- How should I think about things ? --> Let it go, remember my meditation excercise
