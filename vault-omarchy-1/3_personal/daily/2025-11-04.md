#reflection 
- I should sleep sooner, around 8.30 pm
- And I should arrive at cf sooner, 6 am for example 
- Anyway, I must keep working in the morning  because it is the most effective 
- And don't skip reflection/dairy
- From now on, I will track my spent
- I feel something **unpleasant** when I'm *messaging*, why ?
	- It makes me lose my focus
	- It destroy my emotion (make me feel ==uncomfortable==)
- I'm should message when my works are done (or at least after doing some work)
- When I'm at coffee, why I feel like I can't concentrate 100%, although I have already drank coffee ?
	- Not sleep enough 8h 
	- Fairly tired of cardio (running)
- What will I do now ? 
	1. Plan for laptop transfering 
	2. Solve Leetcode problem
	3. Replying friend's messages
	4. Finish CS50 #1

# Leetcode

**Problem: 973**
- INPUT: `points [][2]int, k int`
- OUTPUT: `[][2]int`
- CONSTRAINTS: 
	- 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 (n = points.length)
	- -10^4 <= x, y <= 10^4 
**Sol 1: Sorting**
- Sort `points` by Euclidean distance
- Time complexity: O(NlogN) = 10^5
- Space: O(n)

**Sol 2: Priority Queue (Min Heap)**: 
- We need a structure that can: 
	- Get and remove smallest element: O(1) 
	- Append a new element and can maintain the same sort order of the structure
- Time complexity: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(n)
