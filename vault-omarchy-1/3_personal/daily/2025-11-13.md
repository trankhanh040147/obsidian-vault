#reflection 
- Things are in good shape, I need to keep performing good like this
- There are some issues left:
	- Should I be more active contacting with other people ? --> Of course, I should actively respone to Mom, my friends, and whoever contact me 
	- Should I find a way to take less time on replying --> Yes, reply right when you read the message is essential, it not just make just waste less time, but also keep it natural. Delaying messaging is a way of being passive
	- At work, I need to be more effective. I need to choose between:
		- Coding: Implement features creatively --> Good for pet projects, fast delivery
		- R&D: Learn about the fundamental of the features, understand basic concepts, and alternative --> Good for interviewing 
		- Side projects: Cursor, FE project (When there are no tasks)
		**Balancing: Coding first, R&D later. Keeping it 70 - 30**
