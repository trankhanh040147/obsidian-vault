- Tarot reader is really crazy, isn't it ?
- My tarot for works: 9 of Cups (R), 4 of Wands (R), 2 of Wands (R). That means I'm not happy with my current job like the first days, and I should escape my comfort zone. Let's try to find the creativity more! 
- My tarot for: I feel like I need more time to prepare for job seeking but I spend a little too much on sports. Whether should I invest more time on sports or job preparation (to find a better job)?
	- Cards: The Tower(R), 2 of Cups, The Fool (R), 2 of Wands (U)
		--> I should not spend time on one thing solely, try to balancing two! Not rushing, be in harmony. Find the momentum
- Am I missing anything? What fate is trying to tell me through these Tarot cards ?
- I think the advice is that "not rushing". Matter of fact, I'm kinda a rush person. Does that mean I'm should be aware of things more, and act slowly?
- One reason I cannot stick up to job preparation is that I still not have a strong motivation/feeling/desire to attain/obtain/achive/gain the knowledges for job interviewing (like DSA, CS Fundamentals, SD,...). That leads to my passive activity toward things like: Seeking jobs on te internet, frequently updating CVs, learning about big tech companys (market following).

Thank you for sharing this with me. That's a very deep and honest reflection, and it takes a lot of self-awareness to lay it all out like this. I'm here to listen and help you explore these thoughts.

It sounds like you're in a really challenging "in-between" place. You’re aware you’re unhappy with your current situation (the reversed Wands and Cups), but the path out isn't clear or appealing (the lack of motivation).

Let's look at the pieces you've shared.

### The "Rushing" vs. "Not Rushing"

This seems like the most powerful insight you've uncovered. You've identified a core personal pattern:
> "I'm kinda a rush person."

And you've correctly identified that all the advice you're seeing (from the cards, from your own feelings) is pointing to the opposite: **"Not rushing," "be in harmony," "act slowly."**

This is often the hardest advice to follow, especially when you feel stuck. When we're unhappy, our first instinct is to rush *away* from the bad feeling. But your reflection seems to be telling you that rushing might skip a crucial step.

### Balancing Sports and Job Prep

You're framing this as a conflict: "Should I invest more time on sports or job preparation?"

But your interpretation of the cards (The Tower R, 2 of Cups, The Fool R) was **"try to balancing two!"**

I want to challenge your initial framing. What if sports aren't the *distraction* from your job search? What if sports are the *antidote* to your current job stress?

* The **2 of Cups** is a card of partnership and harmony.
* The **Fool (R)** warns against leaping without looking.
* The **Tower (R)** suggests you're avoiding a necessary change or a "disaster," but forcing it could be chaotic.

Maybe "balance" doesn't mean a 50/50 time split. Maybe it means that sports are the necessary self-care (the harmony of the 2 of Cups) that gives you the mental energy to *face* the preparation, preventing you from "rushing" (Fool R) or "imploding" (Tower R).

### The Heart of the Matter: Motivation

This last point you wrote seems to be the most important part of your entire reflection.

> "One reason I cannot stick up to job preparation is that I still not have a strong motivation/feeling/desire to attain/obtain/achive/gain the knowledges for job interviewing (like DSA, CS Fundamentals, SD,...)."

This is the real barrier. It's not the Tarot cards, it's not the sports, it's not even the old job. It's this.

You *know* what you *should* do to get a "better job," but you feel no "desire" to do it. That's an incredibly frustrating, exhausting, and common feeling. It leads directly to the passive behaviors you mentioned (not updating CVs, not looking at the market).

### What "Fate" Might Be Telling You

You asked, "Am I missing anything? What fate is trying to tell me?"

If we put all these pieces together, the message might be:

**You are trying to solve a *motivation* problem by fixing your *schedule*.**

You're trying to force yourself to study DSA, when your heart isn't in it. The "not rushing" advice might be a call to **stop and figure out the *why*** before you jump into the *how*.

The "balance" (2 of Cups) you need to find might not be between "Sports" and "Studying DSA." It might be between your *current self* (unhappy) and your *future self* (a person who is actually excited about their work).

The motivation for things like DSA and CS Fundamentals is brutal if you don't have a strong *reason*.

So, perhaps the first step isn't to force yourself to study. Perhaps the first step, the "slow" and "aware" action, is to figure out what kind of job would actually give you that "strong motivation/feeling/desire" again.

Would you like to explore that lack of motivation a bit more? For instance, do you think the motivation is missing because you're burned out, or because you're not sure you even *want* the kind of "big tech" jobs that require DSA and CS Fundamentals?

## Me
- I do want a big tech job. Because I want to work with great people, making more money, and work in a greater environment.
- One more reason is that I'm not a person with these natural characteristics: discipline, planned, organised, decisive. This one really cause problem, because it makes me lose my direction constantly. For example, I don't really know what should I do, how should I spend time for my leisure times, and that ends up I do whatever I want that day. For example, this morning I have 2 hours free (from 06.30am - 08.20am) to spend time on studying, but I don't have a specified plan in my mind, so I do what is the most comfortable, which I usually do without thinking, for example here is my morning routine:
	- Wake up: 05.00 am
	- Run: 05.15 - 05.40
	- Bath and prepare to go to cf: 05.40 - 06.15
	- Go to cf & Eat: 06.15 - 06.30am
	- Work: 06.30 - 08.20 
		- Read book ~ 10' --> Reflection ~ 15' --> Solve Leetcode problems/Watch CS Fundamentals courses/Watch system design materials
- Monkey around problem: I often do things without thinking much, because I hate thinking about it beforehand. I know I should practice/train to fix this problem but I don't know how, or should I do it. And sometime I have some plans to do things, but I end up monkey around different things and ended up not doing all the works I should have done.

# Leetcode

**Problem: 973**
- INPUT: `points [][2]int, k int`
- OUTPUT: `[][2]int`
- CONSTRAINTS: 
	- 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4 (n = points.length)
	- -10^4 <= x, y <= 10^4 
**Sol 1: Sorting**
- Sort `points` by Euclidean distance
- Time complexity: O(NlogN) = 10^5
- Space: O(n)

**Sol 2: Priority Queue (Min Heap)**: 
- We need a structure that can: 
	- Get and remove smallest element: O(1) 
	- Append a new element and can maintain the same sort order of the structure
- Time complexity: O(NlogN)
- Space: O(n)
- [ ] Implement:
	- [x] Heapify - Bottom up algorithm
	- [ ] Pop root from Min Heap
	- [ ] Testing and submit 
	- [ ] Calculate Complexity
