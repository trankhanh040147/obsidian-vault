Help me develop a real-time chat web application using the following stack:  
- **Backend:** Golang with the `coder/websocket` library for WebSocket handling to enable efficient, idiomatic, and context-aware real-time communication. Use standard RESTful APIs for user authentication and management, and PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data persistence.  
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, leveraging functional components and React Hooks, with libraries like React Query or Redux for state management and asynchronous data handling.

Please provide:  
1. A clear, modular project structure for both backend and frontend to promote maintainability and scalability.  
2. Recommendations on essential libraries and tools for Golang and React ecosystem to streamline development.  
3. Example code snippets using `coder/websocket` for WebSocket connection setup, message reading/writing with context handling, and React components for the chat UI and message list.  
4. Best practices for handling authentication, error handling, connection lifecycle management, and state synchronization between client and server for a chat application.  
5. Step-by-step instructions to run, build, and test the application locally, including use of Docker or simple scripts for ease of setup.
