I'm continuing work on MongoDB Index Manager frontend.

Context:

- Frontend code in @frontend/ directory

Current Task: [Phase 3: Database Management]

What's Done:
- Phase 1: Foundation ✅

Please review PROJECT_CONTEXT.md and continue from where we left off.
```

# Begin
My decisions:
- Front end locations: frontend/
- Package manager: Bunjs
- Give detail guide (or links, documents) to setup projects/tools/configs... on Arch Linux 
- Testing: leave for now

Let's implement frontend according to FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN
