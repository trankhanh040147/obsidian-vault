# [ID] Problem Name

# Examples

**Input:** h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]

```
rows = [0,0,1,0,0]
columns = [0,1,0,1,1]
```
# Whiteboard
**SOL 1: Find the largest `space`**
- Largest horizontal space: H = max(hc[i+1]-hc[i])
- Largest veritical space: C = max(vc[i+1]-vc[i])
--> Result = `H*C`

- what if `len(hc)==1 || len(vc)==1` ?
	-  append `0` in `hCuts, vCuts`
	- append `h, w` into `hCuts, vCuts`
```markdown
**Input:** h = 2, w = 2, horizontalCuts = [1], verticalCuts = [1]
--> hCuts = [1,2]
--> vCuts = [1,2]
hMax = 1
cMax = 1
--> result = 1
```

**SOL 2: BFS**
- Create a graph to to show reachable paths
	- rows[1..h] Can line `i` reach line `i+1` ?
		- rows[i] mean: can they reach row `i+1` 
	- cols[1..w] Can column `i` reach column `i+1`  ?
- BFS to find the largest **cake**	
	1. Start at [0,0]
	2. Go right/up if possible
	3. Mark as visited 

## 🧠 The "Aha!" Moment
- Largest side of the cake = largest space between cuts
