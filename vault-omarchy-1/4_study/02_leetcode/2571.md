**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 39
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can do the following operations:
- Add 20 = 1 to n, so now n = 40.
- Subtract 23 = 8 from n, so now n = 32.
- Subtract 25 = 32 from n, so now n = 0.
It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of operations we need to make n equal to 0.

# SOL1: Bit Manipulation
- Convert `n` to BINARY base
- Method 1: Substract `n` to power of 2 (Binary Substraction) til it reach 0 --> AKA **counting total 1s**
- Method 2: Turn `0` bits to `1` bits --> AKA **counting total 0s**
**Example 1:**
n = 39 = `100111` 
- *Method 1:*
`100111` - `100000` = `000111` 
... = `000000` (3 ops)
--> Total ops = 4 (wrong)

- *Method 2:*
`100111` + `001000` = `101111`
`101111` + `010000` = `111111`
`111111` - `111111` = `0`
--> 3 ops

**Example A:**
n = `10001`
*Method 2:*
- Total 0s = **3**
*Method 1*:
- Total 1s = **2**
`10001` - `10000` = `1`
`1` - `1` = `0`
