- [x] **The first two things before acting**
    "The first thing to do -- don't get worked up. For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you'll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augutus are now. The next thing to do -- consider carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting -- with kindness, modesty and sincerity"
