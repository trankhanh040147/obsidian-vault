- [x] January 11th: If u want to be unsteady
	- you should shift your caution to your own  reasoned choice & the acts of these choices
	- serenity & stability are the results of your choices and judgment, not your environment
	- Do not seek to avoid the **disruptions** to tranquility. 
		Seek to avoid all the **disruptive judgments** that cause those problems
		ex: I want my mind to be in tranquility, but all the noises prevent me to become that, so I need to avoid 'em --> wrong 
		What I need to avoid is the judgments that other people is the problem --> right
- [x] Jan 13th: Circle of control
	- What is inside your circle of control is just one thing: Your mind. Everything else: the physical body, external events... is outside of it.
